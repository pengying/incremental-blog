It started like any other workday.  In the evening, I checked my calendar for morning meetings.  Standard Tuesday morning company standup followed by a meeting with my manager.  The meeting with my manager was a bit odd, we just had a 1:1 a few days prior.  But, it didn't raise any alarm bells, I thought it was a check-in on a project or some questions on how pieces of the platform worked.  

Companies typically wait until Friday for HR changes right?  Or it happens overnight?  I thought in my head.  I followed the regular evening routine, shower, get the kiddo ready for bed, get into bed myself and putz around on reddit.

The next morning, the company standup followed the same previous patterns.  I then joined Zoom to meet my manager and the first face to meet me was the head of HR.  

<Blockquote>"Shiiiiiiiit", I thought in my head.  I've followed along the layoffs of other companies and guessed what was about to go down.</Blockquote>

The position was terminated.  The HR lead shared the terms of the layoff - which I think are reasonably generous for a series A startup.  Paid until the end of the month then 4 weeks of severance, healthcare until end of next month.  I dropped off Zoom, and tried to collect my thoughts.  I turned up the music, closed my eyes, leaned back into my chair and took a few deep breaths.

I've been speaking with friends who have been laid off and many describe describe feeling disrespected.  People spend so much time and effort at a company and overnight they're shown the door.  No farewell with coworkers, just an email to their personal account.  I didn't feel contempt for what happend, I think I felt a mix of relief and uncertainity.  This was a forcing function to learn something new, to find new challenges. 

There's probably a future blog post about what I think happened, but I want to focus this post on:

* What happend - Done :heavy_check_mark:
* Why Build A Blog
* What's Next

## Why Build A Blog
I spent the next few days coming up with a strawman gameplan.  Trying to figure out what I cared about, my personal priorities, and my personal values.  

I've always shared that if I could retire right now and not worry about financies, I would focus my time and efforts on democratizing education - making high quality education universally accessible (like Khan Academy).  I think access to education and experience absolutely changes life trajectories.

At work I try my best to share my knowledge and experience.  Some of my ex-coworkers reached out and shared things like the following:

<div className="Image__XSmall">
  <Image
    src="/images/linkedinchat.png"
    alt="LinkedIn Chat Log"
  />
</div>

It reaffirmed my persional values and clarified one of my near term goals.  I want to share my knowledge and experience to help educate others.  I spent 14 years at Google, 2 at a startup - learning by tackling technical and non technical problems.  I'm not an expert in many things, but I'll do my best to share an informed perspective.  In addition, in media we mostly hear about successes.  While successes are great learnings, I think we may even learn more from failures and those learnings should be shared as well.

Lastly I felt out of touch with my technical roots.  I haven't put together a full app in a few years and wanted to get back up to speed on modern development.

A blog felt like my preferred medium for sharing information.  However, instead of the easy, efficient choice Medium or Substack, I picked my own stack to get back to speed on web development.  And here we are, [this blog](https://github.com/pengying/incremental-blog) is hosted on Cloudflare and generated with NextJS, React and a dash of Material UI.  Each post is written in my fave format for documents Markdown.  And it scores well in Lighthouse!

There's probably also a blog post about figuring out which SSG / web frameworks to use and the hurdles along the way.  But I'm guessing there's a few other folks who have posted about it already.

## What's Next
For this blog, I eventually want to treat it more as a conversation than a book.  I think it could be handed via chat components eg discored / disqus / fb or discussing on linkedin / reddit but will need to figure that out... later.  In the immediate future I need to spend more time devoted to figuring out the next step in my career and sharing some initial knowledge.

My first series of posts will be sharing my learnings on building APIs and what I think are the most important aspects of a great developer experience.  In terms of API learnings, I'll try to cover the whole gamut - design patterns, schema language, documentation, eng best practices, client libraries, permissions, and more.  In terms of developer experience, I'll focus on it with a product manager lens on it and share my prioritization and rationale.

<Blockquote>TLDR; Got laid off, passionate about sharing knowledge, starting a blog to share insights, learnings, failures.</Blockquote>
